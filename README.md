# Recipher
Recipher is a React/Electrop based desktop client for FocusVision's Decipher platform. Decipher is a powerful web-based survey platform. It is very complex and offers a ton of features and abilities. One of the best features is that surveys can be programmed in either their GUI survey builder or in there custom XML/Python code editor. To fully take advantage of the platform, you need to use both but unfortunately it is a hassle to constantly switch back and forth betweem the two. Recipher is a new interface for Decipher that offers a split view of both the GUI builder and the XML editor with each side updating live as you type.
